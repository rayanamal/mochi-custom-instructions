# Custom instructions for ChatGPT to create Mochi decks (experimental)

This is designed to work with ChatGPT Plus.

1. Open a new project.
2. Set  the instructions as the text in [instructions.md](./instructions.md). 
3. Ask ChatGPT to create a Mochi deck for you.

### Importing into Mochi

1. In Import > Markdown, choose "Multiple .md cards per file".
2. Select the separator as `///`.
3. Choose the file ChatGPT has generated.

## Can I rely on this?

No. This project is experimental, and it's not well tested.

The decks created using ChatGPT this way might have obvious and important flaws. 

In 2025, SRS (spaced repetition system) communities still recommend NOT using AI tools to create flashcards. You may search Anki subreddits for more info on why.

## Contributions

All contributions are welcome, as long as you can reasonably show your changes result in a net improvement.

### TODOs for myself

- Make this into a proper polished CLI tool.
